  <a href="./photos.html">Images from the adventure</a>
  <p>this was a trip that happened <strong>a few months ago</strong> with my friend JC & Nila</p>

  <img style="width: 256px" src="mansfield.jpg" />

  <p>It was on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Mansfield">Mount Mansfield</a> in Vermont</p>

  <p>We planned to hike Mount Mansfield and leave quite early in the morning. Our hiking group ended up leaving later
    than expected (we expected to leave at ~8AM, but actually left at noon. According to a french review on the
    Mansfield All Trails, the hike should have only taken 4-5 hours...</p>

  <p>When we arrived, we spoke with a person who worked for the state park and he let us know that hiking Mansfield
    would take 8-12 hours.</p>
  <p>We decided to hike along a different section of the trail...</p>
  <p>We accidentally ended up on the actual Trail and then it got quite dark.</p>
  <p>Our friends Deet & Dev helped us out though & it ended up working out! :)</p>
